# Advent of code 2025
- All solutions are in rust.
- I have a custom library (crate `aoc`) for input parsing, geometry, vectors, grids, etc.
- I run my bins with the `Makefile`

## Help/hints used
- I often talked to my friends to break down the problem together
- For day 9, I used an llm to make a python script to visualize the polygon with matplotlib.
- For day 9, I had some trouble with the line intersection algorithm. 
I found a function to calculate it from [this website](https://blog.jverkamp.com/2025/12/09/aoc-2025-day-9-polygoninator/), which I adapted for my `aoc` lib.
The rest of the challenge i solved it myself.
